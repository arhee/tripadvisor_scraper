# tripadvisor_scraper

This is a scraper for tripadvisor.com.  It crawls through a country's attractions and deposits them into an SQLite database.

It is currently semi-automatic. It will not restart if there are errors, and it needs a list of city links to begin.

It is not optimized, as it was quickly put together for a small project.
